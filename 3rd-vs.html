     <b><H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></b>
    <CENTEr><p>The Ramayana (/rɑːˈmɑːjənə/;[1][2] Sanskrit: रामायणम्, romanized: Rāmāyaṇam[3]) is a Sanskrit epic from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahābhārata.[4] The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana; the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.</p></CENTEr>
    <b><H3>Etymology</H3></b>
    <CENTEr><p>The name Rāmāyaṇa is composed of two words, Rāma and ayaṇa. Rāma, the name of the main character of the epic, has two contextual meanings. In the Atharvaveda, it means 'dark, dark-coloured, black' and is related to the word rātri which means 'darkness or stillness of night'. The other meaning, which can be found in the Mahabharata, is 'pleasing, pleasant, charming, lovely, beautiful'.[14][15] The word ayana means travel or journey. Thus, Rāmāyaṇa means "Rama's journey", with ayana altered to ayaṇa due to the Sanskrit grammar rule of internal sandhi.[16][17]</p></CENTEr>
